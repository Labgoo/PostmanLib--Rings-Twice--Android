WORKING IN PROGRESS!

'With my brains and your looks, we could go places' - Frank Chambers, The postman rings always twice

LibPostman (Rings Twice) for Android is a library intended to make easier to interact and fetch data with a remote server.

It's basic architecture takes inspiration from Virgil Dobjanschi's talk at Google IO 2010, and it is being developed
after the experience I had interacting with a rest service during the development of MyDearSanta app.


The architecture is intended to be as follows:

A singleton service helper class allows to send messages to an intent service. These messages are converted in intents and
deconverted on the intentservice.

A servercommand performs its execute() method, and notifies the helper that its work is finished through a broadcast message.

Any activity interested in command results can register as listener to the service helper. 


How to use the library:
Classes to extend:

- ServerCommand:
fillIntent & fromIntent method must provide the serialization in order to pass the command to the intentservice
execute is the method that performs the real call. At the moment it must be filled from scratch, soon I'll provide some
examples like a RestInteractionCommand

- CommandFactory:
must be extended in order to provided the ServerCommand defined above


How to use ServiceHelper:

It must be inited (once) with the CommandFactory. I suggest to do it in the onCreate method of the Application.

Every activity can use it to send commands and listen for the results.

This README file will be extended soon with examples as well.
