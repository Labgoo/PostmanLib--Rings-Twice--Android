WORKING IN PROGRESS!

'With my brains and your looks, we could go places' - Frank Chambers, The postman rings always twice

LibPostman (Rings Twice) for Android is a library intended to make easier to interact and fetch data with a remote server.

Its basic architecture is barely inspired by Virgil Dobjanschi's talk at Google IO 2010, and it is being developed
after the experience I had interacting with a rest service during the development of MyDearSanta app.


The architecture is intended to be as follows:

A singleton service helper class allows to send messages to an intent service. These messages are converted in intents and
deconverted on the intentservice.

A servercommand performs its execute() method, ideally stores the results somewhere and then notifies the helper that its work is finished through a broadcast message.
The result of the call must be processed into the execute method (such as storing the data returned by a get into the sqlite storage). 
The activity gets notified that some underlying data was changed. All it has to do is to refresh the data.

Any request is associated to a request id. If a request of the same kind is already pending, another request cannot be performed.

Any activity interested in command results can register as listener to the service helper. 


How to use the library:
Classes to extend:

- ServerCommand:
fillIntent & fromIntent method must provide the serialization in order to pass the command to the intentservice
execute is the method that performs the real call. At the moment it must be filled from scratch, soon I'll provide some
examples like a RestInteractionCommand


- RestServerCommand is a specialized version of ServerCommand, intended to be used for interacting with a rest web service. 
The kind of action to be performed against the webserver must be provided to the command. 
Authentication can be provided (the class exports a static helper method for basic http authentication). It should be easy to 
interact with any kind of webservice

- JsonRestServerCommand simply adds JSON encoding parameter to the call header. 


- CommandFactory:
must be extended in order to provided the ServerCommand defined above


How to use ServiceHelper:

It must be inited (once) with the CommandFactory. I suggest to do it in the onCreate method of the Application.

Every activity can use it to send commands and listen for the results.

The application that uses PostManLib must add the following to its manifest:

  <uses-permission
        android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
outside application tag

and 
       <service
			android:enabled="true"
			android:name="com.whiterabbit.postman.InteractionService" />    

inside the application tag


TO BE ADDED:
OAuth authentication
Instantiate a pool of intent service to perform concurrent activities (remembering that we are still on a phone os after all)
